This project implements a real estate price prediction model using Python and machine learning. The model utilizes historical real estate data to predict the prices of properties based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, etc. The goal is to provide accurate predictions that can assist buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions in the real estate market.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing real estate data for analysis and modeling.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Implementing regression models such as linear regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods to predict property prices.
Evaluation Metrics: Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
